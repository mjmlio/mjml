Here are some tools that utilise MJML:

### Mailjet

[Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/demo/) offers an integrated MJML workspace designed for creating, previewing, and managing email templates. Its MJML editor supports syntax highlighting, live preview, and validation, helping you move quickly while keeping your markup in good shape.

The drag-and-drop editor in Mailjet is also built on MJML, so visually created templates share the same responsive structure as those coded by hand.

When your template is ready, you can export it in MJML or HTML, or send emails directly through Mailjet.

### Parcel

[Parcel](https://parcel.io) is the code editor built for email. This feature packed tool includes syntax highlighting, Emmet, inline documentation, autocomplete, live preview, screenshots, and full MJML, CSS, and HTML validation.

Use Focus Mode to keep the preview aligned with the code you're working on, or Inspect Element to easily find the code that produces specific elements in the preview.

Export MJML to HTML with a click.

### IntelliJ IDEA Plugin - MJML Support

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is an IDE developed by JetBrains. The plugin provides you with a (near) realtime preview, auto complete, inline documentation and code analysis.

It is available on the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16418-mjml-support).

### Gradle Plugin - MJML Compilation

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is a build tool for a various set of languages and environments. The plugin provides an easy way to embed your MJML templates to your Java/Kotlin application in its resources in precompiled form (HTML).

### Neos CMS
