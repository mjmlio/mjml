# Creating a Component

One of the great advantages of `MJML` is that it's component-based. Components abstract complex patterns and can easily be reused. In addition to the standard library of components, it is also possible to create your own components!

We have published a step-by-step guide [here](https://medium.com/mjml-making-responsive-email-easy/tutorial-creating-your-own-component-with-mjml-4-1c0e84e97b36) that explains how to create a custom components with `MJML 4`. It will introduce to you the [boilerplate repo](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml-component-boilerplate) hosted on Github, which provides a fast way of getting started developing your own components.
