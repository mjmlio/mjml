## Tooling

In order to provide you with the best and most efficient experience using MJML, we've developed some tools to integrate it seamlessly into your development workflow:

### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free code editor made by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/). We recommend this package as it is among the most feature-rich MJML plugins for code editors; with live previews, syntax highlighting and linting, as well as export features including HTML and screenshots.

It is available [on Github](https://github.com/mjmlio/vscode-mjml) and through the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mjmlio.vscode-mjml).
