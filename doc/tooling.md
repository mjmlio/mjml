# Tooling

In order to provide you with the best experience with MJML and help you use it more efficiently, we've developed some tools to integrate it seamlessly in your development workflow:

## Visual Studio Code
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free code editor made by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/). We recommend this package as it is the feature-richest MJML plugin for code editors with live previews, syntax highlighting and linting as well as export features including HTML and screenshots. It is available [on Github](https://github.com/mjmlio/vscode-mjml) and through the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mjmlio.vscode-mjml).

## Atom language plugin
[Atom](https://atom.io) is a powerful text editor originally released by [Github](https://github.com). This package provides autocompletion and syntax highlighting for MJML. It is available [on Github](https://github.com/mjmlio/language-mjml) and through the [Atom Package Manager (APM)](https://atom.io/packages/language-mjml).

## Atom linter
In addition to the language plugin, a linter is available to highlight errors in MJML. The linter is available [on Github](https://github.com/mjmlio/atom-linter-mjml) and through the [Atom Package Manager (APM)](https://atom.io/packages/linter-mjml).

## Sublime Text
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a powerful text editor. We're providing you with a package to color MJML tags. It is available [on Github](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml-syntax) and through the [Sublime Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MJML-syntax).

## Gulp
Gulp is a tool designed to help you automate and enhance your workflow. Our plugin enables you to plug the MJML translation engine into your workflow, helping you to streamline your development workflow. It is available here on [Github](https://github.com/mjmlio/gulp-mjml)
