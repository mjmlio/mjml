## Tooling

In order to provide you with the best and most efficient experience using MJML, we've developed some tools to integrate it seamlessly into your development workflow:

### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free code editor made by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/). We recommend this package as it is among the most feature-rich MJML plugins for code editors; with live previews, syntax highlighting and linting, as well as export features including HTML and screenshots.

It is available [on Github](https://github.com/mjmlio/vscode-mjml) and through the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mjmlio.vscode-mjml).

### Sublime Text

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a powerful text editor. We’ve provided you with a package to color MJML tags.

It is available [on Github](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml-syntax) and through the [Sublime Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MJML-syntax).

### Gulp

[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) is a tool designed to help you automate and enhance your workflow. Our plugin enables you to plug the MJML translation engine into your workflow, helping you to streamline your development workflow.

It is available here on [Github](https://github.com/mjmlio/gulp-mjml).
