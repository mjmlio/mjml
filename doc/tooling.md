# Tooling

In order to provide you with the best experience with MJML and help you use it more efficiently, we've developed some tools to integrate it seamlessly in your development workflow:

## Atom language plugin
[Atom](https://atom.io) is a powerful text editor originally released by [Github](https://github.com). This package provides autocompletion and syntax highlighting for MJML. It is available [on Github](https://github.com/mjmlio/language-mjml) and through the [Atom Package Manager (APM)](https://atom.io/packages/language-mjml).

## Atom linter
In addition to the language package, a linter is available to highlight errors in MJML. The linter is available [on Github](https://github.com/mjmlio/atom-linter-mjml) and through the [Atom Package Manager (APM)](https://atom.io/packages/linter-mjml).

## Atom preview
The Atom preview package enables you to see how your email renders as you code, directly within Atom. The preview package is available [on Github](https://github.com/mjmlio/atom-mjml-preview) and through the [Atom Package Manager (APM)](https://atom.io/packages/mjml-preview).

## Sublime Text
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a powerful text editor. We're providing you with a package to color MJML tags. It is available [on Github](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml-syntax) and through the [Sublime Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MJML-syntax).
