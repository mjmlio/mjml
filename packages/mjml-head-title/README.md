### mj-title

Defines the document's title by populating the title tag. This can be shown in the browsers title bar in some cases.

Its content is also used to populate the value of the `aria-label` attribute located in the immediate child `div` of the `body` tag, which is used to aid accessibility.

```xml
<mjml>
 <mj-head>
   <mj-title>Hello MJML</mj-title>
 </mj-head>
 <mj-body>
   <mj-section>
     <mj-column>
       <mj-text>
         Hello World!
       </mj-text>
     </mj-column>
   </mj-section>
 </mj-body>
</mjml>
```
